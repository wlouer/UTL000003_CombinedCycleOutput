Combined Cycle Power Plant (Source of Image: GE Power, data is not necessarily based on GE equipment)


# Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Modeling 
## Combined Cycle Power Plant Output

The project included an exploratory data analysis and training and testing of regression models to predict the output of a combined cycle power plant based on a small number of environmental variables.  


#### Dataset source:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aagmandeep/combined-cycle-power-plant-dataset-and-prediction
